For a more complete and structured overview of the changes made since the fork, see:

👉 [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./IMPROVEMENTS.md)

## 🧩 Important Glass Keep features still present

This fork also keeps the main capabilities that already made the original project attractive:

- 🔐 authentication and multi-user support
- 👑 admin panel
- 🗝️ secret recovery key login
- 📝 Markdown notes, checklists, drawings, and images
- 👥 real-time collaboration on notes
- 📦 import / export with cross-device duplicate detection
- 📥 Google Keep import (Takeout `.zip` — full colour, images, line breaks)
- 🤖 optional AI assistant via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, Open WebUI, LiteLLM, OpenAI, …)
- 📲 PWA support

---

## 📱 Android app + 📺 Android TV 

A native Android companion app is available for GlassKeep, making self-hosted mobile usage more convenient.

The Android app is a WebView wrapper for GlassKeep Enhanced and does not necessarily change with every project release.

The **same APK also runs on Android TV** — the app detects leanback hardware (or the `?tv=1` URL override) and switches the React frontend to a dedicated TV layout designed for the couch and the D-pad. No separate build, no separate install: phone, tablet and TV all share one codebase. See section **4** of [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) for the full TV layout details.

The launcher icon, the Android TV banner, the PWA install icon, and the favicon have all been redrawn from a single master so the app looks coherent across every surface.

[Download latest Android APK](https://github.com/Victor-root/glasskeep-enhanced/releases/download/v2.2.0/GlassKeep-v1.1.0.apk)

Current APK version: `1.2.0`

> The Android source code is available in the `android/` directory.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Recommended native installation (Debian / Ubuntu / Proxmox LXC)

Run as **root** on a clean Debian-based system:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Victor-root/glasskeep-enhanced/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The script is designed to make installation as simple as possible:
- it directly offers **install / update / uninstall**
- it asks for the important information up front
- it creates the admin account
- it generates the configuration automatically
- it sets up the systemd service
- it can handle **HTTPS** depending on your setup:
  - **reverse proxy**
  - **self-signed certificate**
  - **custom SSL certificate**
- it optionally sets up **at-rest encryption** to protect notes in the database (you can enable it later from the admin panel if you prefer)

> This is the main installation method recommended for this fork.

---

### 🐳 Docker installation

Docker is also available, especially for NAS and similar environments.

#### Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/glasskeep && cd ~/glasskeep && cat > docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'
services:
  glasskeep:
    image: ghcr.io/victor-root/glasskeep-enhanced:latest
    container_name: glasskeep
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      ADMIN_EMAIL: "your-admin-username"
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: "choose-a-strong-password"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
EOF
docker compose up -d
```

Then:
1. open `http://<your-host>:8080`
2. sign in with the admin username and password you chose

#### Update

```bash
cd ~/glasskeep && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Your data stays preserved in the `./data` directory.

## 🤖 AI assistant

GlassKeep no longer ships an embedded local model — it was too small to be genuinely useful. Instead, it connects to any **OpenAI-compatible** chat endpoint, so each instance picks what fits its hardware, privacy needs and budget — fully local with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) / [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), or remote via OpenAI, OpenRouter, …

Two AI features are available once configured:

- **🔎 Global AI search** — ask questions across your notes from the search bar. The backend pre-selects relevant notes before calling the model, and only cites notes it actually received (no fabricated sources).
- **🗒️ Per-note assistant** — discuss the currently opened note with the AI. Conversations are temporary by default; a save button can keep them per note.

Admins control AI at the instance level: disable it entirely, configure a **server-side provider** (optionally shared with users so the API key stays hidden), or let each user bring their **own endpoint** in their settings.

> ⚠️ Notes sent to a remote provider leave your GlassKeep instance. For sensitive data, prefer a local setup such as **Ollama + Open WebUI** on your LAN/LXC.

Recommended starter model (light enough to run even on CPU-only setups):

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M
```

> 📘 Full setup guide — base-URL gotchas, model recommendations, privacy notes, admin/user config flows → [`AI_CHANGES.md`](./AI_CHANGES.md)

## 🌍 Adding a new language

1. Copy `src/i18n/locales/en.js` to a new file, for example `it.js`
2. Translate the values
3. Import the locale in `src/i18n/index.js`
4. Adjust detection logic if needed
5. Rebuild the app

Missing keys will automatically fall back to English.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🗓️ Planned
- More translations with better RTL language support
- Make the Android app available on **F-Droid**

### 💭 Under consideration
- *(open — suggestions welcome)*

---

## 🔐 Security

- `JWT_SECRET` is automatically generated by the native install script
- if you run the server outside the script, you must provide your own valid secret
- serving the app behind HTTPS is still recommended
- the recovery secret key should be treated like a password

## 🙏 About this fork

This repository is first and foremost a fork built on a foundation I genuinely liked.

I originally started looking for a self-hosted and open-source alternative to Google Keep. I found **Glass Keep**, liked its direction, its interface, and especially the potential of its foundation. This fork started very modestly, with the idea of adding a French translation, and gradually evolved into a broader set of improvements.

The goal here is not to replace the original project, nor to move “against” it.  
On the contrary, the reason this fork grew so much is precisely because the foundation of **Glass Keep** made me want to spend a lot of time improving it.

Thanks to [nikunjsingh93](https://github.com/nikunjsingh93) for the original project and its foundation.
