# 📋 Changelog

## 🚀 v2.3.6 — 2026-05-15

### ➕ Added
- 🌍 **Language picker in settings** — themed dropdown to override the auto-detected language (Automatic / Français / English), saved server-side and synced via `PATCH /user/profile`
- 🔁 **Server restart button** in the admin panel — confirmation modal, in-progress spinner, post-restart countdown, automatic hard refresh
- ⛔ **Server shutdown button** in the admin panel — same UX, polls until the server is unreachable before confirming
- 📶 **Server-unreachable indicator** — the amber "offline" badge now also appears when the browser is online but the server can't be reached
- 💬 **Clearer AI test-connection errors** — surfaces the provider's actual error message, with human-readable hints for common HTTP status codes (401 invalid key, 405 wrong base URL, 429 rate limit, etc.)

### 🔄 Changed
- 🌐 **Smarter browser-language detection** — now reads the user's prioritized list (`navigator.languages`) instead of just the browser UI locale, so Firefox / Chromium users whose preferred content language differs from the UI get the right locale automatically
- 🗄️ **HTTP caching tuned for local-first** — `stale-if-error` lets the cached app shell survive a server outage so notes remain accessible offline

### 🐛 Fixed
- 🍎 **iOS checklist keyboard bug** — tapping a section title on iPhone / iPad no longer makes the keyboard pop up and immediately close
- 🔕 **Suppressed spurious "Request timed out" toasts** on page load when the server is unreachable (the offline indicator already covers it)

### 🛠️ Upgrade

**Native install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Victor-root/glasskeep-enhanced/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## 🚀 v2.3.5 — 2026-05-15

### ➕ Added
- ⚡ One-click in-app update from the admin panel (native + Docker)
- 🔘 "Update manually" toggle for the raw curl / docker compose commands
- 📖 "View changelog" button in the admin panel
- 📊 Live RAM / Swap / CPU gauges during a native update
- 🛑 Cancel button with snapshot-based rollback
- 🎉 Auto-pop changelog modal after a successful update
- 🌍 AI translation of the changelog with live streaming
- 🛠️ Expert "Show details" panel with the raw update log
- 🧠 Smart Node heap sizing using RAM + swap so small hosts don't OOM
- 💡 Friendly failure hints (OOM, network, permissions, disk full)
- ⚙️ `UPDATE_BRANCH` / `UPDATE_BUILD_HEAP_MB` env vars for advanced setups

### 🔄 Changed
- 📦 `install.sh` now ships a dedicated `glass-keep-updater.service`
- 🐳 `docker-compose.yml` mounts the Docker socket out of the box
- 🔒 Update dismissal is now server-side, so the modal doesn't re-pop in private browsing or on another device

### 🐛 Fixed
